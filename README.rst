What does it do?
================

Runs a test command when some file is created/modified/deleted,
showing the returned value in a GUI.

There are 3 states:

- *Red*: Last test job failed/errored (it didn't return zero)
- *Yellow*: Running a test job
- *Green*: Last test job passed (it returned zero)

The test job output is written on the standard output, so it should
appear in the console/terminal whereby Dose was called. The same
applies to the standard error, whose text should appear in red.


Syntax / Example
----------------

Just call ``dose TEST_COMMAND``, where ``TEST_COMMAND`` is what you
would call to run your test suite in a terminal/console/shell. Dose is
written in Python but the test command can be any shell command.

*Hint (color)*: Any ANSI escaping code from the test command (e.g.
colors) is also sent to the standard streams in the underlying
console (Linux, Mac OS X and Cygwin) or converted by colorama_ to
Windows Console Handles API calls (Windows). In other words, colors
are enabled. For example, in a tox + py.test Python project whose
``tox.ini`` has ``commands = py.test {posargs}``, you can force the
py.test coloring with ``dose tox -- --color=yes``.

*Hint (shell)*: You can use shell pipes in your test command by
quoting the whole command, e.g. ``dose "cat tests.txt | verify.sh"``.


What does it watch?
-------------------

Using the watchdog_ package, Dose recursively watches a working
directory for file creation/modification/deletion events.

The watched directory is the current working directory whence
Dose was called. You can change it from the GUI. The test
command is called in the same directory.

There's a customizable ignore pattern to avoid undesired detections on
temporary/compiled files.

Valid events during a test would kill (SIGTERM) a test job to restart
it. There's a 10ms delay before starting/spawning a test job
subprocess, which is kept alive for at least 50ms before being able to
be killed. Multiple events are handled as a single event to avoid
spawning/killing more than required.

There's a cycle/repeat detection in the watcher: repeating an event
won't kill the test job. Modifying the same file twice will have the
second modification ignored, unless it happens after finishing a test
job.

*Hint (change directory)*: You can watch a directory and call a
command in another directory by using ``cd PATH && TEST_COMMAND`` as
your test command, e.g. ``dose "cd toxinidir && tox"``.

Installation
============

Dose has few requirements:

- Linux, OS X, Windows or Cygwin (Windows)
- Python (2 or 3) with pip/wheel/setuptools
- PyPI packages (auto-installed):

  - watchdog
  - docutils
  - colorama
  - wxPython 2.8, 3.0 (either Classic or Phoenix) or 4+ (Phoenix)

All the packages are installed with `pip`, including wxPython,
but this last one you might need/want to install by using a build
packaged in your operating system repository, so the following
documentation, once created for older versions of wxPython (before its
4.0 release), was kept here as part of the documentation.

On Python 3, wxPython Phoenix is required (since wxPython Classic
requires Python 2, modus tollens). Even on Python 2, Phoenix is
usually easier to install, as it can be installed directly via pip
no matter the platform or Python version::

  pip install wxPython

The wxPyWiki have a detailed page on `how to install wxPython`_\ ,
whence that Phoenix install command came. The link includes some
detailed information on how to install wxPython Classic.

If that's not enough, below are some detailed information on how to
install Dose and its requirements on each platform/environment/system
it supports.


Installing Dose with pip/wheel/setuptools
-----------------------------------------

You should install with pip, which gets the Dose wheel from PyPI_
(recommended)::

  pip install dose

To install from the source distribution (e.g. after cloning this
repository), you can either use pip (recommended)::

  pip install .

Wheel::

  python setup.py bdist_wheel
  wheel install dist/*.whl

Or setuptools directly (not recommended)::

  python setup.py install

To uninstall Dose with pip while keeping its requirements installed::

  pip uninstall dose

Other useful and self-explanatory commands are::

  pip install --upgrade dose
  pip install --force-reinstall dose

Dose should be kept upgraded. To check which Dose version is
installed, you can use ``pip list`` or ``pip freeze``\ . Without pip,
you can check the version from the ``dose.__version__`` variable::

  python -c "import dose ; print(dose.__version__)"


Python virtualenv
-----------------

If you wish to install Dose in a Python virtualenv instead of a system
installation, you should either:

- Install wxPython Phoenix via pip (recommended);
- Create a virtualenv with the ``--system-site-packages``
  option in a system that already has some wxPython version
  installed.

On Linux / Mac OS X / Cygwin, this creates a ``venv27`` directory with
a new virtualenv that can access the system ``site-packages`` library
directory, i.e., the installed packages::

  virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python2.7 venv27

On Windows, you should just replace ``python2.7`` by your
``python.exe`` file. You should remove the ``--system-site-packages``
for a virtualenv with independent libraries.

To activate it (Linux / Mac OS X / Cygwin)::

  source venv27/bin/activate

To activate it (Windows)::

  venv27/Scripts/activate.bat

Afterwards, you should install Dose with pip/wheel/setuptools in the
activated virtual environment.

If virtualenv isn't available in your Python distribution, it can be
installed with::

  pip install virtualenv


.. linux


Requirements on Arch Linux
--------------------------

For a simple installation, it's available in AUR_\ .

This distro doesn't include a ``/usr/bin/pip`` script, so you should
use ``python2 -m pip`` (Python 2) or ``python -m pip`` (Python 3)
instead of just ``pip``\ . By the way, in this Linux distribution
``python`` means Python 3, only ``python2`` means Python 2, unless
you're in a virtualenv. The commands below should be called with
``sudo``.

When installing pip, you don't need to worry if the Python interpreter
itself is installed in your system, as the package manager would
install python for you as a dependency if it's not installed. To
install pip and wxPython Phoenix 4 on Python 3::

  pacman -Sy python-pip python-wxpython

The wxPython Phoenix snapshot can be installed via pip. On the other
hand, to install pip and wxPython Classic 3.0 on Python 2::

  pacman -Sy python2-pip python2-wxpython3

If you wish to install Dose in a virtualenv, you should install the
``python-virtualenv`` (Python 3) or the ``python2-virtualenv``
(Python 2) package with pacman, following the virtualenv instructions
afterwards.


Requirements on Ubuntu/Debian/MINT Linux
----------------------------------------

You should use ``pip3`` instead of ``pip`` on Python 3, unless you're
in a virtualenv. The commands below should be called with ``sudo``\ .
You can also install the described packages (names after
"\ *install*\ ") with an APT GUI like ``synaptic``\ . These
distros usually come with Python, nevertheless Python itself is
installed as a dependency when installing pip. Before calling the
install commands, remember to::

  apt-get update

Installing pip on Python 3::

  apt-get install python3-pip

The wxPython Phoenix snapshot can be installed via pip. To install pip
and wxPython Classic 2.8 on Python 2::

  apt-get install python-pip python-wxgtk2.8

If you wish to install Dose in a virtualenv, you should install the
``python-virtualenv`` (Python 2) or the ``python3-virtualenv``
(Python 3) package from APT, following the virtualenv instructions
afterwards. If these aren't available, you should install the
virtualenv package from PyPI with pip.


.. linux end
.. osx


Requirements on Mac OS X
------------------------

Everything discussed here happens in a console, you can open one with
Spotlight by pressing Command (⌘) + Space and typing ``Terminal``\ .
The recommended (and easier) way to install the requirements is via
Homebrew_\ , even in Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan). Another option
would be installing Python directly from the `Python official site`_
packages, but that installation procedure isn't described here.

**Python from Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)**

This is an installation procedure without Homebrew_\ , using the
Python interpreter that comes with Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan).
It comes with Python 2.7, but not with pip. You can install pip
using the command::

  curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python

If you wish to install wxPython Phoenix via pip without receiving an
``OSError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: ...``\ , you have to
temporarily disable the *System Integrity Protection*, but that's
something you probably don't want to do. The same happens with Dose,
but to avoid that issue you can install Dose directly from its
``setup.py`` instead of using pip/wheel.

On the other hand, if you wish to install wxPython Classic 3.0,
you should get the "Cocoa" Mac OS X binary packages directly from the
`wxPython official site`_\ . But that's not enough, as the package
structure isn't supported by this OS X version. Following the
instructions from `the DaviXX' Blog post about wxPython on OS X`_\ ,
you should:

- In Finder, open (double click) the downloaded dmg file;

- Click with the right mouse button (or Ctrl + click) on the
  ``wxPython3.0-osx-cocoa-py2.7.pkg`` file, and click on
  *Show Package Contents*\ ;

- Drag the ``Contents`` directory to your Desktop and, on the same
  Finder window, eject the "wxPython"-prefixed device;

- Open ``Contents``\ , then open ``Resources``\ , there you should
  rename:

  - ``preflight`` to ``preinstall``
  - ``postflight`` to ``postinstall``

- Open (double click) ``wxPython3.0-osx-cocoa-py2.7.pax.gz``\ , there
  should appear an ``usr`` directory;

- Create two directories in that very same ``Resources`` directory,
  with the names:

  - ``pkg_root``
  - ``scripts``

- Move (drag):

  - ``usr`` to ``pkg_root``
  - ``preinstall`` to ``scripts``
  - ``postinstall`` to ``scripts``

- In a Terminal, type these 2 commands (be careful, you should use the
  ``~`` symbol, not the ``˜`` symbol)::

    cd ~/Desktop/Contents/Resources
    pkgbuild --root ./pkg_root --scripts ./scripts \
             --identifier com.wxwidgets.wxpython \
             ~/Desktop/wxPython3.0-osx-cocoa-py2.7-repackaged.pkg

Wait until the Terminal gives you the *Wrote package* message. You can
now delete the Contents directory and the downloaded dmg, just open
(double click) the ``wxPython3.0-osx-cocoa-py2.7-repackaged.pkg`` file
in your desktop and wxPython Classic 3.0 is installed. The
aforementioned blog post does the same procedure, but in a command
line approach.

**Homebrew**

A single command in a Terminal is enough to install Homebrew_\ ::

  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

In a terminal, before calling the install commands, remember to::

  brew update

To install Python 3 (already comes with pip, henceforth called
``pip3`` for this Python version)::

  brew install python3

There you can install wxPython Phoenix via pip (replacing ``pip``
by ``pip3`` in the install command).

To install Python 2 (already comes with pip) and wxPython Classic 3.0::

  brew install python wxpython


.. osx end
.. windows


Requirements on Windows
-----------------------

On Windows, you can install Python from some distribution or directly
from the `Python official site`_ binary packages, the procedure
described here uses the latter approach.

The installation asks for adding Python to the path, you should add it
to use ``python``\ , ``pip`` (and ``dose`` afterwards) on any path.
It's recommended that you keep the installation directory simple (e.g.
the paths where tox_ looks for Python interpreters: ``C:\Python27``
for Python 2.7 and ``C:\Python35`` for Python 3.5), as the
``python.exe`` isn't renamed nor copied to version-specific filenames
and that becomes an issue if you wish to keep more than one Python
version installed. The suggested path is the default for Python 2.7,
but for Python 3.5 you have to choose *Customize installation* to
change the path.

The Python binary packages for Windows already comes with pip as 3
executable files in the ``Scripts`` subdirectory on the path where
Python was installed: ``pip.exe``\ , ``pipA.exe`` and
``pipA.B.exe``\ , where ``A.B`` is the Python version (e.g. ``2.7``
or ``3.5``\ ).

A terminal is required for installing Dose and its requirements, as
well as for using Dose afterwards. You can use either the
*Windows PowerShell* (\ ``powershell.exe``\ ) or the *Command Prompt*
(\ ``cmd.exe``\ ), they can be called by pressing *Windows + R* and
typing the executable filename (without the ``.exe``
suffix/extension).

If you wish to install wxPython Phoenix, it can be easily installed
via pip using the formerly described command, you just have to care
about the path: you can see if pip is in the path by trying to call
it or by seeing in the PowerShell if ``$env:path`` includes the
Python scripts directory (e.g. ``C:\Python27\Scripts``\ ). If not,
you should go to that directory before calling pip, e.g.::

  cd \Python27\Scripts
  pip install dose

On Python 2.7, you can install wxPython Classic from the package in
the `wxPython official site`_\ . If you've installed Python in the
recommended path, the installer should detect the installation path.
If you installed Python on ``C:\Python27`` (the Python installation
path and also the directory where the ``python.exe`` lies), then
you should install wxPython on ``C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages``.
If Python was installed otherwhere, the ``\Lib\site-packages``
suffix should be added accordingly. When asked, use the full
installation (i.e., everything checked).


Requirements on Cygwin (Windows)
--------------------------------

If you just wish to run Dose on Windows, you should read the previous
section instead. Cygwin_ is another platform, one that runs on Windows
and has many resources from Linux. On Cygwin, even the Python
resources are the ones documented as available in POSIX systems.

To install Python 2 and wxPython Classic 3.0 on Cygwin, you
have to install these packages from the Cygwin installer (as well
as their dependencies detected by the installer):

- ``Net/curl``
- ``Python/python``
- ``Libs/python-wx3.0``
- ``X11/xinit``
- ``X11/xorg-server``

Open the *Start Menu -> Cygwin-X -> XWin Server*\ , it will just flash
and disappear, but its X and C icons should appear in the taskbar.
Click on the *C icon -> System -> Cygwin Terminal* to open a terminal
that can display a X GUI in Windows.

To install pip, you should use this command in the Cygwin Terminal::

  curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python

To activate wxPython Classic 3.0 (i.e., to make it the default
wxPython installation)::

  cd /lib/python2.7/site-packages
  echo wx-3.0* > wx.pth
